Hi, I'm **Aes Saputra** - a Full Stack Developer and Cloud Engineer who enjoys shipping products, automating infrastructure, and documenting the process for future me.

### About This Site
This site is built with Jekyll, published via GitHub Pages, and synced from my personal Obsidian vault. It acts as a living notebook where I publish quick notes, long-form writeups, and experiments in the open.

### Contact

> Write it down, automate it later. Documentation is the foundation of every scalable system.
