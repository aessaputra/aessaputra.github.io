Welcome to my writing space, I'm [Aes Saputra](/about). Here I collect lessons, experiments, personal reflections, and any ideas that feel worth sharing.

Start exploring:

- [Notes](/notes) for quick captures covering tech tips, book highlights, workflows, and whatever else I'm tinkering with.
- [Writing](/writing) where I explore projects, personal ideas, and the practices that help me grow.

Each page evolves along with my projects, curiosities, and ongoing experiments.
